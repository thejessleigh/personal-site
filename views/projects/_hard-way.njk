    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        There are tons of streamlined resources that make our lives as devs easier, but sometimes hinder long term
        understanding and growth. I'm here to explain why junior developers should spend their first job using command
        line git, avoiding ORMs, and making as many mistakes as possible.
    </p>

    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>This talk was originally written for Dev Together Chicago's January 2019 meeting with talks themed around "Your
        first dev job". This talk is specifically designed for students and recent graduates seeking their first job. It
        is not appropriate for a mixed or advanced audience.</p>
