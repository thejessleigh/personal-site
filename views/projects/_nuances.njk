    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        I'll briefly go over three Python gotchas that have given me headaches in the past that I wish I had known about earlier. We'll talk about a good use case for deepcopy, why default mutable arguments are unexpectedly tricky, and the difference "is" and "==" comparators.
    </p>
