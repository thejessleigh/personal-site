    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>I'm a software and data person, writer, public speaker, and community organizer.</p>

    <p>I attended Dev Bootcamp (RIP) in 2014 and work at as a software engineer in Chicago.</p>

    <p>One of my passions is providing career support and continuing education to fellow career changers. I co-organized
        the Chicago chapter of PyLadies from 2015 to 2017, and I help organize <a href="https://pyohio.org">PyOhio</a>,
        the Midwest's largest Python conference. I also write and speak about software development, marginalized genders
        in tech, community building, and professional development.</p>

    <p>If you would like me to speak at your event, please look over <a href="/speaker">my speaker info</a> to make sure
        we're on the same page. The best ways to reach out to me are <a
