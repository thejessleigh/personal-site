        I'll be at PyCon in May. Come say hi! Otherwise, I'm just living my day to day life, nothing too exciting. We'll probably be gearing up for PyOhio 2019 soon and I'm looking forward to that.

       The top is blue, but the blue dye has washed out of the ends, so they're purple again. Aiming to get it redone at the end of March. I think I'll keep with the blue for a while.

        I got two beautiful fuzzy boys in January 2019. The tuxedo cat is named Darien, after Tuxedo Mask from Sailor Moon. The fluffy grey one is named Aleister Meowley. They are my floofy loves.
